Welcome, have a seat. I'm a Backend Developer with vast experience in designing and building scalable and efficient backend systems. 

Currently a full-time Lead Software Engineer.

You can find some of my open-source work here. Though, don't be surprised, in recent years JS & TS has been my daily driver.

Enjoy!
